## `data/`

These are the example data files from the genus *Betula* that were used in our manuscript.
Here we have provided simulated read count data and error values that can be analyzed using our program `ebg`.
Instructions for how to do so can be found on the [GitHub pages website](http://pblischak.github.io/polyploid-genotyping) associated with this repository.
