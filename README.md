This is the GitHub repository for the manuscript "SNP genotyping and parameter estimation in polyploids using low-coverage sequencing data", which is currently under peer review. The repo consists of four main folders:

 - `ebg/`: C++ source code for EM/ECM algorithms for genotyping with our models.

 - `helper-scripts/`: Perl and bash script for extracting allele depth info from a VCF file for use with `ebg`.

 - `Rcode/`: R and C++ code for performing simulations and for running analyses.

 - `data/`: the empirical data sets for *Betula pendula*, *B*. *pubescens*, and *Andropogon gerardii* that were used in the manuscript.

 - `docs/`: Rmd and HTML files for GitHub pages site.


More details on the contents of each folder can be found in their respective README files.
