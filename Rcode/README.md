## `Rcode/`

These are the R, C++, and bash scripts that were used to conduct the simulation study for our manuscript.
To run them, you will need to have the R package `Rcpp` installed.

### `diseq` simulations

Create a folder called `simDiseq/`, then execute the bash script `simDiseq.sh`:

```bash
# Make folder
mkdir simDiseq

# run simDiseq bash script
bash simDiseq.sh
```

### `alloSNP` simulations

Create a folder called `simAlloSNP/`, then execute the bash script `simAlloSNP.sh`:

```bash
# Make folder
mkdir simAlloSNP

# run simDiseq bash script
bash simAlloSNP.sh
```

### `alloSNPdrift` simulations

Create a folder called `simAlloSNPdrift/`, then execute the bash script `simAlloSNPdrift.sh`:

```bash
# Make folder
mkdir simAlloSNPdrift

# run simDiseq bash script
bash simAlloSNPdrift
```
